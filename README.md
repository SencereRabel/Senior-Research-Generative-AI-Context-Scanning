# Evaluating Generative AI Context Scanning: Text Formatting and Needle Placement

This research project investigates the impact of text formatting and "needle" placement on the context scanning capabilities of generative AI models.

## Project Objective

To determine how variations in text formatting and the placement of a target piece of information (the "needle") within a larger context influence a generative AI's ability to accurately retrieve and utilize that information.

## Background

**Context Scanning:** Refers to the process by which a generative AI analyzes input text to identify and extract relevant information.

**"Needle":** Represents the specific piece of information a model is tasked with retrieving from the surrounding context, like trying to find a needle in a haystack.
